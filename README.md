# QGO Desktop Assessment

## Overview

The test is completes all objectives required and is a MVP, and is unit tested

There are however improvements to the application that can be made. 

* There is no persisent storage, ideally the test state would persist within local storage, so that changes are not lost upon refresh.
* The test lacks any custom styling. Ideally the test should be fully responsive with styled components and elements.
* The unit tests could be more thorough, such as testing button clicks, and ensuring this reacts with the reducer, and updates the store as expected.
